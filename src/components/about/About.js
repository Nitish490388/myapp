    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hii, I'm Nitish Kumar Jena, a Full stack Web Developer, Having eagerness to solve realworld problems and most importantly a cricketer in Free TimeüòÅ.</p>
    <p>I love to try and learn new things from my best teacher, INTERNET. Yep your read it right! Everything nowadays can be learned from internet for free of cost (if you have a internet connection of course which also comes after paying money, so not exactly free but yeahüëΩ).</p>
    <p>So first back in 2020 I initially took admission in a college, due to some reasons I did not get much more scope from my college end to chase my small dreams. I learned basic java programming language and started solving problems on different platforms. However I did not make a resonable effect on my carrier due to inconsistency. I just came to know abbout the CODING SHUTTLE a coding platform and get enrolled for the fullstack web development course. I did successfully complete that course and Now I am a Fullstack developer in specializing MERN.</p>
